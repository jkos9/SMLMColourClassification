# SMLMColourClassification

This package was used for my thesis at UCL classifying spectral emission of quantum dots using neural networks.

This research was conducted at the Simoncelli Lab at the London Centre for Nanotechnology: https://simoncelli-lab.com.

This package can isolate single emitters from multi emitter .tiff microscopy files using proccessEmitters_getparams.py and then properly scale data for the NN algorithm using scaleEmitters.py. 

For binary or multi emitter classification use BinaryColourClassification.ipynb or MultiColourClassification.ipynb.
